Did the data subject give informed consent?
[article 7, recital 32]

### Terms

* **Informed consent**
	Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them.
	The data subject should have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed about this, as it should be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. 
	This information can be found at [article 7](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/) and [recital 32](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-32/) of the GDPR.
